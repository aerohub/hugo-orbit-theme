### Test your site

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

### Build your site

Just run

	$ hugo

You'll find your resume files in `public` folder in the root of Hugo project.


## Generate a PDF version

Although there is a free Sketch template provided by [@xriley](https://github.com/xriley) ([Link](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/resources/sketch-template/orbit-sketch-sketch-resume-template-for-developers/)), you might do not want to write / copy & paste the contents again and / or don't have access to a Mac with the Sketch program.

[@Lednerb](https://github.com/Lednerb/) discovered the following way to generate PDFs with this theme in an easy way for developers as follows:

1. Finish the website
2. Within Chromium / Chrome: `CTRL+P` (Print), change settings to borderless, only the first page and printer to "Save as PDF"
3. `CTRL+SHIFT+I` to open the development panel
4. Remove contents in the sidebar and the already saved sections, maybe also sections that should not be placed on the second page
5. Repeat step 2 to save the next page as a new document
6. Reload the site, repeat steps 4 and 5 until all pages are saved
7. Use a tool like `pdfunite` to merge the different PDF files / pages into one file
8. You can add the generated file to the downloads section if you like
